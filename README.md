Sentiment analysis of tweets using LSTM vs GRU neural networks.

**Introduction**
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. With the advent of social media platforms like Twitter, sentiment analysis has gained significant importance as it allows businesses and individuals to understand public opinion and sentiments towards various topics, products, or events. In this code a detailed analysis of a sentiment analysis system developed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for analyzing sentiments in tweets.
